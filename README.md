### Abstract
Edge precision is crucial in medical image segmentation. Previous work using U-Net has achieved significant performance in general medical imaging segmentation. However, edge detection can be further refined. In this research, we propose a novel reverse channel attention mechanism to enhance border performance. Along with three other attention mechanisms—spatial, channel, and scale attention—we apply it to skin lesion segmentation. The segmentation results were comparable to previous works.

### Requirements
Some important required packages include:
* [Pytorch][torch_link] version >=0.4.1.
* Visdom
* Python == 3.7
* Some basic python packages such as numpy, matplotlib, etc.
